Modern Gangster: 1970s Wave Perm Series

A cinematic AI art project exploring the aesthetics of 1970s gangster culture – style, emotion, and rebellion – visualized through AI-generated character sketches and scenes.  
Each image represents a story of identity, ambition, and love in a world of smoke, suits, and secrets.

## ☯ Concept
This series captures the raw energy and emotional tone of 1970s film noir and urban crime dramas.  
The “Wave Perm” hairstyle became a visual signature – symbolizing confidence, chaos, and charisma.  
Through this collection, I reinterpret that era with modern cinematic lighting, composition, and AI stylization.

## 🎬 Creation Process
- **Toolchain:** AI image generation + Lightroom editing + composition refinements  
- **Workflow:** Idea → Prompt crafting → Image generation → Curation → Enhancement  
- **AI Style Reference:** 1970s Hong Kong / Italian noir / American New Wave films

## 🔗 Proof & Authorship
All artworks in this project are AI-generated and curated by **DavidDesign1988** (GitHub: **David1988-x**).  
Each piece is timestamped, verified via C2PA, and linked to decentralized vault logic on Arweave and OpenSea.  
These works are **not for commercial sale** and exist as a **record of authorship and creative provenance**.

 Future releases will expand the series with additional cinematic batches, continuing the exploration of AI-driven visual storytelling.
